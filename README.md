This repo lets you run various simple CV demo routines.  The one thing it needs from you is a json file which contains various local paths which obviously should not be commited to the repo.  It should be called "local_cfg.json" and look like this:

{
    "repo_dir" : "<path/to/my/repos>/IntroCV"
}

The repo will figure everything else out from there.
